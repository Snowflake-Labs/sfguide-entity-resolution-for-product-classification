# Entity Resolution from Text - Retail Product Classification

## Overview
Retailers and e-commerce platforms often face challenges in aggregating data about their products, which limits them in various aspects such as supply chain management, competitive pricing, demand forecasting, inventory optimization and much, much more. The root of this issue can be attributed to the lack of standardized UPCs or product descriptions across these various retailers and e-commerce platforms, resulting in a complex system that creates a need for companies to spend hundreds of thousands on DBT jobs or various other approaches to harmonizing their product data. Addressing these challenges with a centralized, AI-driven approach can empower these retailers to gain actionable insights off their product perforamnce based on the data available.
